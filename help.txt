If the user has trouble opening video files recorded using this program:
Install Additional Codecs:
Sometimes additional codecs need to be installed separately to support certain video types. For example, installing packages with H.264 support might help. On Ubuntu, you can install codec packages with the following commands:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras


If the user has an NVIDIA graphics card but still cannot run the program:
Check NVIDIA Driver Status:
Run the following command in the terminal to check if the NVIDIA driver is installed on your system:

    ubuntu-drivers devices


This command will show a list of available drivers and indicate whether NVIDIA is installed.

Install NVIDIA Driver:
If the NVIDIA driver is not installed, you can install it using the command:

    sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall


This command will automatically install the recommended NVIDIA driver for your graphics card.

Restart the System:
After installing the NVIDIA driver, it's recommended to restart your system to apply the changes.
